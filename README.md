# Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries 
---

## Overview

This task focuses on mastering **subqueries** and **nested queries** using SQL.
The goal is to demonstrate advanced query logic using scalar, correlated, and nested subqueries in various SQL clauses.
---

## Objectives

- Implement subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses
- Use scalar and correlated subqueries effectively
- Understand and apply concepts like `IN`, `EXISTS`, and derived tables
---

## Tool Used : **MySQL Workbench**
---

## Contents

- `SQL-TASK-6.sql`: Contains all SQL queries demonstrating subqueries and nested logic
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the task and approach
---

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Subquery**: A query nested inside another query
- **Correlated Subquery**: A subquery that references columns from the outer query
- **Scalar Subquery**: A subquery that returns a single value
- **Derived Table**: A subquery in the `FROM` clause treated as a temporary table
- **EXISTS vs IN**: Logical operators used to test for existence or membership
